He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis.

If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.", "orig_sample_length": 509, "prompt_length": 309, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.8980588912963867, "w_bl_gen_time": 3.8866467475891113, "no_bl_output": " work for the same day.Achasey be one or \u2018s. and also had a fantasy football player is not one or any place where they made a long time. have a number one-no, hey-related to orbit and in trial-incessed as it is a common-sofantasy 8, but their jobs are in the most likely to close in the list of the next day. and at the same thing to be aware of your home. a lot of the after which can\ufffd a few days off the bench. so-first position this is called for the other than a full rollback in the best of the case where they have a few days to help you can be able to the payment in a little child\ufffd\n of the last three days after months ago that\ufffd new ones of the ship\ufffd an alternate that has to be out in which is a good to take the night britual and the \u201ct of a little rat-all", "w_bl_output": " (and/early for the best eight years ago, preferably in conjunction with each day. include a day. be able to the way to the star about 2. a local government-one. the same time signature. and the entire of a few days of anti-up.\ufffd or right-based picking on a non-wish led to be pre-day-placeholder in front line. a couple of a couple of a few days of a minute. the same day after lots of a day. and stealer-based upon. as well-begga classic, then hedonation-s. so many people can be the same as well-based upon the same day. but let alone for the originality of a personable parents of anyhow it was the first, a few days of any type of a few days ago to the basics in your friend. sitt is a newspaper reporter. a case, I can be fed to the best known as well-", "no_bl_num_tokens_generated": 200, "w_bl_num_tokens_generated": 200, "no_bl_sec_per_tok": 0.019490294456481934, "no_bl_tok_per_sec": 51.30758810405902, "w_bl_sec_per_tok": 0.019433233737945557, "w_bl_tok_per_sec": 51.45823970857657, "baseline_loss": 5.708618640899658, "baseline_ppl": 301.4543762207031, "no_bl_loss": 4.339880466461182, "no_bl_ppl": 76.69837188720703, "w_bl_loss": 4.247527599334717, "w_bl_ppl": 69.93229675292969}
