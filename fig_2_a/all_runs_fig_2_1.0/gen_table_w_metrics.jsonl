If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.", "orig_sample_length": 509, "prompt_length": 309, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.9736526012420654, "w_bl_gen_time": 4.005286455154419, "spike_entropies": [[0.9981679916381836, 0.9916555881500244, 0.9985575675964355, 0.9884763360023499, 0.9989197850227356, 0.9915950298309326, 0.9474568367004395, 0.9905698299407959, 0.9547420740127563, 0.9881905317306519, 0.9992502927780151, 0.9957593679428101, 0.9985427260398865, 0.9806369543075562, 0.9708676934242249, 0.9908466339111328, 0.9988793134689331, 0.9858102798461914, 0.9988932609558105, 0.9980357885360718, 0.8574755787849426, 0.9986497163772583, 0.9797384142875671, 0.9914623498916626, 0.9611905813217163, 0.9989498853683472, 0.989246129989624, 0.9858584403991699, 0.9996142387390137, 0.9962020516395569, 0.9977360367774963, 0.997503936290741, 0.9899574518203735, 0.894269585609436, 0.9699875116348267, 0.9985104203224182, 0.9988442063331604, 0.9938108325004578, 0.98637455701828, 0.9996135234832764, 0.9938581585884094, 0.9941112399101257, 0.9606016874313354, 0.9048536419868469, 0.9985510110855103, 0.9907618761062622, 0.998498797416687, 0.9858894944190979, 0.9446390867233276, 0.9986332654953003, 0.9829792380332947, 0.976957380771637, 0.9996508955955505, 0.9715908765792847, 0.9829117655754089, 0.963622510433197, 0.9948790073394775, 0.9983681440353394, 0.9792946577072144, 0.9996317625045776, 0.9976662397384644, 0.9874350428581238, 0.982708215713501, 0.9861429929733276, 0.9445117115974426, 0.9089710712432861, 0.9862260222434998, 0.9906161427497864, 0.9809624552726746, 0.9937461614608765, 0.9744551181793213, 0.9841225147247314, 0.964630126953125, 0.9978570938110352, 0.78889000415802, 0.9987890720367432, 0.9260415434837341, 0.9425902366638184, 0.9989966750144958, 0.9620885848999023, 0.986465334892273, 0.999029815196991, 0.9783788323402405, 0.9708484411239624, 0.9772729873657227, 0.9990466237068176, 0.9814756512641907, 0.9878373146057129, 0.9803271889686584, 0.9759230613708496, 0.997521162033081, 0.8324846029281616, 0.9846206307411194, 0.9964636564254761, 0.975922703742981, 0.9917762875556946, 0.9786576628684998, 0.9441900253295898, 0.9964184761047363, 0.9979978799819946, 0.9674786925315857, 0.9876322746276855, 0.9988899230957031, 0.9804147481918335, 0.9934961199760437, 0.9952786564826965, 0.9276301264762878, 0.9985191226005554, 0.9622892141342163, 0.9775720238685608, 0.9867570400238037, 0.9691970944404602, 0.998245358467102, 0.9647477865219116, 0.8154039978981018, 0.9771966338157654, 0.9978657960891724, 0.9788870811462402, 0.9991419315338135, 0.9888737797737122, 0.9962198734283447, 0.9953638315200806, 0.9992033243179321, 0.9478654861450195, 0.9803695678710938, 0.9990360140800476, 0.99146968126297, 0.9908691048622131, 0.998998761177063, 0.9933916926383972, 0.9870448708534241, 0.9845925569534302, 0.9862138032913208, 0.9123814105987549, 0.9807838201522827, 0.9989723563194275, 0.9145083427429199, 0.9884340763092041, 0.9988674521446228, 0.9979192018508911, 0.9904257655143738, 0.9990902543067932, 0.9107869863510132, 0.9984219074249268, 0.7720867991447449, 0.9956532120704651, 0.9990031719207764, 0.990145742893219, 0.9361690282821655, 0.9689764976501465, 0.9977613687515259, 0.9547577500343323, 0.9983676671981812, 0.9826198816299438, 0.9940809011459351, 0.9803328514099121, 0.9977260828018188, 0.8066387176513672, 0.998468816280365, 0.9884612560272217, 0.9705193638801575, 0.9905901551246643, 0.9989023804664612, 0.9591076374053955, 0.9990238547325134, 0.9808142781257629, 0.9967870116233826, 0.9981757402420044, 0.964165985584259, 0.9626725912094116, 0.9729023575782776, 0.997654139995575, 0.9987127184867859, 0.8913280367851257, 0.998349130153656, 0.9924076795578003, 0.9989253878593445, 0.9759805798530579, 0.9984309673309326, 0.9843347668647766, 0.9870100021362305, 0.7933761477470398, 0.9987252354621887, 0.9938676357269287, 0.9748890399932861, 0.8963116407394409, 0.9820013642311096, 0.996624231338501, 0.9752450585365295, 0.9790677428245544, 0.9867733716964722, 0.9814811944961548, 0.9979240894317627, 0.9702500700950623, 0.998263955116272, 0.997092604637146, 0.9987700581550598, 0.9916384220123291, 0.9837159514427185, 0.9826672077178955]], "no_bl_output": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt\u2019s an experience that might humble some.

{"idx": 3, "truncated_input": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years.

That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon.", "orig_sample_length": 866, "prompt_length": 666, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 4.217026710510254,

{"idx": 10, "truncated_input": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and", "baseline_completion": " delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world.

The suspected shooter was 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, a man McCluskey\u2019s family said she had recently stopped dating. Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland. There was \u201csome follow-up\u201d and it was assigned to a detective who was \u201cworking to build a case against our suspect at that time,\u201d Brophy said. The police chief would not go into further details about what happened with that investigation.\nOn Monday night, Brophy said that police got a call from a frantic mother saying \u201csomething happened to her daughter.\u201d In a statement released by the McCluskey family, McCluskey\u2019s mother said that she was on the phone with her daughter that night when she suddenly heard Lauren McCluskey yell \u201cno no no!\u201d Afraid her daughter was in a car accident, she stayed on the line while her husband called 911. A few minutes later, the family statement said, \u201ca young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren\u2019s things were on the ground.\u201d It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey\u2019s body, Brophy said. The university issued an alert and an order for students to \u201csecure-in-place.\u201d It was lifted at 11:46 p.m., according to the university\u2019s website, after police determined that Rowland was no longer on campus. Brophy said that Rowland was picked up by a vehicle and, about 1:15 a.m. he was spotted by Salt Lake City police who ran after him. Rowland got inside the Trinity AME Church, where he killed himself.

{"idx": 12, "truncated_input": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4", "baseline_completion": "Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.", "orig_sample_length": 1459, "prompt_length": 1259,

{"idx": 13, "truncated_input": "The location of the July 15, 2002 flare is shown at left. The other panels compare the scale of Earth to the eruptions. Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release", "baseline_completion": " of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency.

{"idx": 14, "truncated_input": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you", "baseline_completion": " need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.", "orig_sample_length": 1259, "prompt_length": 1059, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 4.044034957885742, "w_bl_gen_time": 4.469681978225708, "spike_entropies": [[0.9630463719367981, 0.953477144241333, 0.9954370260238647, 0.9975847005844116, 0.9679954648017883, 0.9909016489982605, 0.9984809756278992, 0.9695383310317993, 0.9948663711547852, 0.9989241361618042, 0.9425775408744812, 0.9920859336853027, 0.9840222597122192, 0.976661205291748, 0.9949865341186523, 0.9775986671447754, 0.9606733918190002, 0.9948751926422119, 0.9769864082336426, 0.9902324676513672, 0.9937257766723633, 0.9715127348899841, 0.9955604672431946, 0.9978806972503662, 0.9794867038726807, 0.9988232851028442, 0.9966498017311096, 0.990440845489502, 0.9989018440246582, 0.9898273944854736, 0.9741851687431335, 0.9979745745658875, 0.9897047281265259, 0.998763918876648, 0.9942357540130615, 0.9983309507369995, 0.8637496829032898, 0.9956896305084229, 0.9728744029998779, 0.9789941310882568, 0.9868957996368408, 0.9793379902839661, 0.998698890209198, 0.9789581298828125, 0.9848993420600891, 0.9891993999481201, 0.9989534616470337, 0.9928483366966248, 0.9986552596092224, 0.9990493059158325, 0.9949390292167664, 0.9835469126701355, 0.9978779554367065, 0.9988423585891724, 0.9693310260772705, 0.9847548007965088, 0.9813970327377319, 0.9989012479782104, 0.9871389269828796, 0.9896429181098938, 0.9156543016433716, 0.9894661903381348, 0.9932200908660889, 0.9593520164489746, 0.9894722104072571, 0.9913703203201294, 0.7519975900650024, 0.9899899959564209, 0.9889881610870361, 0.9669079780578613, 0.9958474636077881, 0.9935681819915771, 0.988976001739502, 0.9991551637649536, 0.9230329990386963, 0.8972103595733643, 0.9893622994422913, 0.9808666706085205, 0.9815090894699097, 0.998292088508606, 0.9933562278747559, 0.9978428483009338, 0.9205156564712524, 0.9788625240325928, 0.9989049434661865, 0.9932347536087036, 0.9877628684043884, 0.9887522459030151, 0.9911806583404541, 0.7617277503013611, 0.9894813299179077, 0.9988447427749634, 0.9923262596130371, 0.9983882904052734, 0.9911424517631531, 0.9944024682044983, 0.9981374740600586, 0.9987919926643372, 0.9582218527793884, 0.9986615180969238, 0.9947801828384399, 0.9785850644111633, 0.9988444447517395, 0.9520138502120972, 0.9590597152709961, 0.9989107847213745, 0.993880569934845, 0.9811182022094727, 0.997370719909668, 0.9877405762672424, 0.9488463997840881, 0.9792001247406006, 0.9762747883796692, 0.9885266423225403, 0.9705832600593567, 0.990176796913147, 0.962308943271637, 0.9560357332229614, 0.9948606491088867, 0.766871452331543, 0.9884514808654785, 0.9940650463104248, 0.9981478452682495, 0.94292151927948, 0.9923065900802612, 0.9833697080612183, 0.979144275188446, 0.9752300381660461, 0.9797889590263367, 0.998846709728241, 0.9926315546035767, 0.7778955101966858, 0.9816137552261353, 0.9164121747016907, 0.9850802421569824, 0.968347430229187, 0.9742583632469177, 0.9817275404930115, 0.9846281409263611, 0.9972184300422668, 0.9878329038619995, 0.9937703609466553, 0.7579560279846191, 0.9885306358337402, 0.9921535849571228, 0.7469522356987, 0.9892390966415405, 0.9986623525619507, 0.9938194751739502, 0.9770138263702393, 0.9670403003692627, 0.9987393617630005, 0.9932944774627686, 0.9887274503707886, 0.9372974038124084, 0.9982152581214905, 0.9991532564163208, 0.7822070121765137, 0.9799031615257263, 0.9892512559890747, 0.9956157207489014, 0.9722618460655212, 0.9890612363815308, 0.9683859348297119, 0.9824691414833069, 0.9987431764602661, 0.986311674118042, 0.9972765445709229, 0.9977381229400635, 0.9729508757591248, 0.9644872546195984, 0.9944533109664917, 0.9859442114830017, 0.9391404986381531, 0.9911996722221375, 0.9868194460868835, 0.9755475521087646, 0.9870152473449707, 0.9839399456977844, 0.9905843734741211, 0.9245631694793701, 0.9714058637619019, 0.9532839059829712, 0.9906192421913147, 0.9979177713394165, 0.9668455719947815, 0.9794448018074036, 0.9980669021606445, 0.8718613386154175, 0.9913930892944336, 0.9856845140457153, 0.9105130434036255, 0.9037578701972961, 0.978699266910553, 0.9987757802009583, 0.9940003752708435, 0.9721891283988953, 0.9971266984939575, 0.9709171056747437, 0.9968377351760864]], "no_bl_output": " can give you can make a lot of great news, not only to be surety, which means you can be careful. in these days, but not to be interviewed and are you yourself, but the Axis of course it was designed to get your home at the same as well-always look at all the company of the business.

{"idx": 19, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said.", "baseline_completion": " That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year.", "orig_sample_length": 1010, "prompt_length": 810,

It appears Feiglin is on his way back to the Knesset, while Tibi just sank below the threshold minimum vote.\nAn Israel Hayom poll published Friday morning shows former IDF chief of staff with 19 seats, the Likud down from 30 to 28, the Labor Party falling to its lowest point so far \u20135 seats, Yair Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid stuck in the mud with 9 seats (down from its current 11, which is down from its previous Knesset list of 19), and, for the first time in this campaign, the Zehut (Identity) party, headed by former Likud MK Moshe Feiglin who is a regular pundit at Jewish Press Online, crossing the electoral threshold with 4 seats.\nThe numerous splits of the past few months, on the left and on the right\u2014some of which may end up merging by the official deadline set by the Central Elections Committee, have led to many parties that are swinging just above or just below the: Gesher, headed by Orly Levy-Abekasis, receives 4 seats, while Shas, Meretz, Habayit Hayehudi receive only 3.\nHere\u2019s another doozie: Both Avigdor Liberman and his nemesis Ahmad Tibi get only 3 seats and walk into the setting sun, probably not hand in hand.\nAnd like we said, Zehut, headed by Cool Hand Feiglin, which just held the first open primaries in Israel ever on Tuesday, and did it online (you gave them your ID number and cell number, they SMSed you a code, you clicked in and got to spread 6 points among the candidate/s of your choice) is also on the verge of the electoral threshold \u2013 but for the first time looking at the abyss from above, with 4 seats.\nParties that are so far from the threshold they\u2019re already in Party Heaven (doesn\u2019t that sound like the place you\u2019d want to go when the time comes) are Tzipi Livni and Eli Yishai, each of whom receives but one mandate.\nThe survey examined a scenario according to which Gantz and Lapid unite and bring in former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi.

Well, the poll showed that 25% of respondents still do not know how to define him.\nAfter the pollsters removed the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d results, 52% of the rest located Gantz at the center, 19% see him as a right-winger, and 29% as left-winger.\nFinal surprise: on the issue of who is more suitable to be the next prime minister, Netanyahu leads safely with 38%, while Gantz gets only

{"idx": 24, "truncated_input": "What\u2019s the news? A couple of weeks ago, Instagram promised you\u2019d be able to download your data from its servers. It\u2019s now rolled out that feature, as first reported by TechCrunch. It includes photos, videos, comments, profile information and more. It does not, however, appear to include all the analytics data the company has on you outside of what you\u2019ve shared.\nFor context: While we\u2019d like to think Instagram will let you download your data simply out of the goodness of its heart, there are two major factors contributing to the decision.\nFirst there\u2019s the Cambridge Analytica scandal (I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it by now", "baseline_completion": ", but if you need a recap, our explainer post is here).\nEven if Cambridge Analytica had never happened though, allowing users to download data is an important step for complying with Europe\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR goes into effect on May 25, so don\u2019t be surprised to see plenty of other apps implementing a similar feature. In fact, you can already do so with Facebook.\nDownload it: The feature is available to everyone via the Web now, and is in the process of rolling out to the Android and iOS apps. Still, whether you\u2019re on a desktop of smartphone, you can go ahead download your data by inputting your account information here. Keep in mind it takes some time for Instagram to amass all your data; the company says the process may take \u2018up to 48 hours.\u2019 After that\u2019s complete, you\u2019ll receive a link at the provided email address.", "orig_sample_length": 352, "prompt_length": 152, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.404517412185669, "w_bl_gen_time": 3.943591833114624, "spike_entropies": [[0.9854643940925598, 0.968174159526825, 0.9403449296951294, 0.9731351733207703, 0.7021978497505188, 0.9939514398574829, 0.9949150681495667, 0.998815655708313, 0.9910811185836792, 0.9722585082054138, 0.9989360570907593, 0.9780494570732117, 0.9648071527481079, 0.9889512658119202, 0.9886117577552795, 0.9981905817985535, 0.9852942228317261, 0.9727509021759033, 0.9696815013885498, 0.9587419629096985, 0.9770987629890442, 0.981357216835022, 0.9912227392196655, 0.758642315864563, 0.9808310270309448, 0.9889528751373291, 0.742926299571991, 0.9816181659698486, 0.9039495587348938, 0.9822749495506287, 0.9778217077255249, 0.9982411861419678, 0.902390718460083, 0.965667188167572, 0.9926339387893677, 0.9920468926429749, 0.9944778680801392, 0.9869951605796814, 0.8858364820480347, 0.9982286691665649, 0.9865661859512329, 0.9028615951538086, 0.9851552248001099, 0.9629884362220764, 0.9956048130989075, 0.9988633394241333, 0.9849051833152771, 0.9977302551269531, 0.9788199663162231, 0.9927948713302612, 0.9325600862503052, 0.9888051152229309, 0.9979993104934692, 0.9881312847137451, 0.9742189049720764, 0.9906448125839233, 0.9933565855026245, 0.9975671768188477, 0.9788333773612976, 0.9858201146125793, 0.9956270456314087, 0.9495648145675659, 0.9778323769569397, 0.9747776389122009, 0.9975929856300354, 0.9651944637298584, 0.9874086976051331, 0.9988497495651245, 0.9394334554672241, 0.9863587021827698, 0.9210943579673767, 0.9916995167732239, 0.9982647895812988, 0.9867432713508606, 0.9826122522354126, 0.9893276691436768, 0.9910434484481812, 0.9981393218040466, 0.9875326156616211, 0.9922031164169312, 0.9636105298995972, 0.9987527132034302, 0.9219626188278198, 0.9837633967399597, 0.9552150964736938, 0.9049589037895203, 0.9901108741760254, 0.9981705546379089, 0.9822484850883484, 0.9919369220733643, 0.9584132432937622, 0.9981400966644287, 0.8999168872833252, 0.9758518934249878, 0.9884043335914612, 0.9756690263748169, 0.9939233064651489, 0.9797229766845703, 0.9966734647750854, 0.9986199140548706, 0.9914987683296204, 0.9899966716766357, 0.9931150078773499, 0.969266414642334, 0.9987436532974243, 0.9831320643424988, 0.9431468844413757, 0.9633274078369141, 0.9043296575546265, 0.9871580600738525, 0.7492820024490356, 0.9766117334365845, 0.9981611967086792, 0.9936272501945496, 0.955527663230896, 0.9987331032752991, 0.98602294921875, 0.9935282468795776, 0.9640659093856812, 0.9226726293563843, 0.9879261255264282, 0.9987536668777466, 0.9822893738746643, 0.9962196350097656, 0.9981807470321655, 0.9846696257591248, 0.9680155515670776, 0.9880588054656982, 0.9981500506401062, 0.9790362119674683, 0.9574577808380127, 0.9914778470993042, 0.952445924282074, 0.9944664239883423, 0.8877363204956055, 0.9944869875907898, 0.9593082666397095, 0.9985618591308594, 0.9046759605407715, 0.9886956214904785, 0.9898746013641357, 0.9980921745300293, 0.789103627204895, 0.9652318954467773, 0.9172685146331787, 0.9868584275245667, 0.9352855682373047, 0.9726277589797974, 0.9836857318878174, 0.9631819128990173, 0.9979896545410156, 0.9959986805915833, 0.9911559820175171, 0.9716272354125977, 0.9621175527572632, 0.9349794983863831, 0.9870709776878357, 0.9986308813095093, 0.993090808391571, 0.9495300650596619, 0.9722378849983215, 0.9732784628868103, 0.9985872507095337, 0.9930821061134338, 0.726253092288971, 0.9605377316474915, 0.9980521202087402, 0.9857014417648315, 0.9966813921928406, 0.9986246228218079, 0.9906104803085327, 0.9836912155151367, 0.9558638334274292, 0.9981236457824707, 0.9768558740615845, 0.9981018304824829, 0.97996985912323, 0.9818407893180847, 0.9981215000152588, 0.9930514693260193, 0.8863730430603027, 0.962746798992157, 0.9986284375190735, 0.994972825050354, 0.9499186277389526, 0.8654313683509827, 0.9980313181877136, 0.9741635322570801, 0.9613260626792908, 0.8935291171073914, 0.9800395369529724, 0.9984195828437805, 0.9956676959991455, 0.9608345031738281, 0.9982997179031372, 0.8282439708709717, 0.9637573957443237, 0.9959341287612915, 0.9624939560890198, 0.9952178597450256]], "no_bl_output": " is a great work for the rest of your a system to be.\u201d.

{"idx": 25, "truncated_input": "President Donald Trump returned to Washington, DC on Monday for a very important event.\nIt was not for a meeting with an international leader.\nAnd it was not for a joint session of Congress.\nNo, on this day, Trump greeted thousands of children. They had come to the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll.\nThe event has been a U.S. tradition for more than a century. In the late 1800s, local children gathered on the hill beside the president\u2019s house to play a game with their colored eggs following the Easter holiday.\nThe White House Easter Egg Roll was of special interest this year. The Trump administration was very late to organize it. Some people who hoped to attend the event were even worried that it would be canceled.\nPolitical observers said the Easter Egg Roll would show how well Trump\u2019s administration could plan and operate a complex public relations event.\nTalk about the event also brought attention to the first lady, whose office usually plans the White House Easter Egg Roll. First Lady Melania Trump has not yet moved to Washington, DC. She says she will remain in New York City until her son finishes the school year.\nSo, how did the White House Easter Egg", "baseline_completion": " Roll go this year?\nJust fine, early reports say.\nAbout 21,000 children and their families received tickets to this year\u2019s event. They came in small groups to the lawn near the president\u2019s house. They played soccer, tossed bean bags and, of course, pushed hard-boiled eggs down the hill.\nThe event was smaller than in previous years. Last year, for example, about 36,000 people attended.\nThis year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll also did not include performances by top celebrities or professional athletes. Instead, children were invited to draw pictures for U.S. soldiers.\nThe Easter Bunny made an appearance, though, as did both Trump and the first lady.

{"idx": 26, "truncated_input": "So you might ask yourself, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d How can things be so bad that educators feel the need to petition?\nSuperintendent Michael Hanson\u2019s administration issued a mandate to all school principals, vice principals and counselors to lower the number of suspensions and expulsions districtwide using a repackaged, rhetoric-filled behavioral modification program called Restorative Justice.\nThis Restorative Justice concept is not new. These interventions usually fail under the weight of their overexaggerated promises. This leads to an odd belief that if you decrease the number of official suspensions on paper, you can claim success regarding improved behavior.\nFresno Unified board member Christopher De La Cerda, McLane\u2019s representative, highlighted this delusion when he stated, \u201cThe data confirms that restorative practices at McLane are working as we intended it to work.\u201d Sort of like bragging that no one drowned in the pool after the water was removed.\nIf the intention was for more than 80 percent of the teaching staff to be so fed up they needed to file a petition \u2013 congratulations! Mission accomplished.\nThe saddest part of this debacle is that it has ironically resulted in increased insecurity and systemic violence for our teachers and students who truly want to be educated.\nBut here is the most disappointing fact: This situation did not need to happen; it was self-inflicted.\nThree years ago, there was a wonderful, accredited, academic program in Fresno Unified that took in up to 1,600 secondary students a year, who either could not \u2013 or should not \u2013 attend a traditional high school.\nThis program was a last-chance beacon of hope for thousands of students who, by their own fault or the fault of others, would have had no real chance of graduating from high school. It was called the J.E.Young Academic Center (JEY). It provided an educational sanctuary for the very students FUSD is trying to corral with this Restorative Justice debacle.\nEvery student was treated \u2013 educationally and emotionally \u2013 as a unique individual. JEY accepted the entire spectrum of students; from those whose special needs could not be adequately met, to those whose behaviors could not be adequately accommodated on a traditional high school campus. This program was an oasis for students", "baseline_completion": " on the precipice of failure.\nIt was a wonderful independent study program that served the needs of those most in need. Everybody won. But that didn\u2019t matter.\nFor spurious and ego-driven reasons, this program was dismantled and diminished to a mere shell of its former self. It was replaced by a program that failed after two years. Like prisons, it involves removing those in society with unacceptable behaviors and placing them into a concentrated environment of only themselves.\nIf shooting oneself in the foot was considered a good thing, then FUSD could qualify as a world-class marksman regarding this issue. If FUSD really wanted to practice restorative justice, it would bring JEY back to its previous stature. Maybe Larry Powell could help.\nWilliam (Bill) Larkin monitors online credit-recovery classes in the Apex program. He taught in the JEY program for eight years.

{"idx": 29, "truncated_input": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he", "baseline_completion": " deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line

What did kemo sabe mean? \u2013 boss, or pal, or champion of justice, or paleface idiot?\nWhen I was little, there was no radio in our house; our parents were deaf. Our grandparents had a big table-model Philco in their parlor. Just as kids nowadays tease for an iPhone, I kept asking for a radio until I got it. A tiny, dark-brown Bakelite-cased Arvin, it sat on the sideboard in our dining room.\nEvery weekday, from 4:45 till 6:00 in the afternoon, I pulled my long-legged chair up to the sideboard, turned on the radio, and gazed at the dial. Many of you must remember \"watching the radio\" and memorizing the numbers of the AM dial, from 520 to 1610 kilohertz. I could tell from the glances I got from my parents as I sat there \u2013 sitting still for longer than at any other time in my life \u2013 that they suspected I was listening to something inappropriate and possibly sinful.\nAt 4:45 a voice crackled over a simulated radio transmission: \"CX4 to control tower.

{"idx": 34, "truncated_input": "No, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself. The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing \u201cthe fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone\u2019s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else\u2019s conduct, the justice of someone else\u2019s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution\u2019s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed king would have been spared instead of going to the chopping block.\nWe know of not a single instance of a self-pardon having been recognized as legitimate. Even the pope does not pardon himself. On March 28, 2014, in St", "baseline_completion": ". Peter\u2019s Basilica, Pope Francis publicly kneeled before a priest and confessed his sins for about three minutes.\nPresident Trump thinks he can do a lot of things just because he is president. He says that the president can act as if he has no conflicts of interest. He says that he can fire the FBI director for any reason he wants (and he admitted to the most outrageous of reasons in interviews and in discussion with the Russian ambassador). In one sense, Trump is right \u2014 he can do all of these things, although there will be legal repercussions if he does. Using official powers for corrupt purposes \u2014 such as impeding or obstructing an investigation \u2014 can constitute a crime.\nBut there is one thing we know that Trump cannot do \u2014 without being a first in all of human history. He cannot pardon himself.\nElizabeth Holtzman: In the Russia probe, could Trump pardon himself?\nDana Milbank: Trump can do whatever he wants.

{"idx": 43, "truncated_input": "The Congress of South African Trade Unions has noted the latest cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma. We can confirm that the federation did receive a courtesy call from President Jacob Zuma regarding his decision to reshuffle his cabinet this morning.\nWhile, we acknowledge that the president of the republic has a prerogative to reshuffle his National Executive as per the Constitution of the republic, we find the frequency of these cabinet reshuffles unsettling because they do not help to create the much needed stability at a government level. What compounds the situation is that some of these government departments are also witnessing an exodus of senior technocrats.\nAll of this is happening while workers and the poor are continuing to be victims of a system that has condemned millions of our fellow citizens to lives of brute survival. Our economy is currently haemorrhaging jobs at an alarming rate and it does not help that we are also experiencing this kind of political uncertainty and policy incoherence from government.\nCOSATU expects cabinet reshuffles to be about strengthening the capacity of government in order to help", "baseline_completion": " government to better implement its developmental agenda and deliver on its promises. We are not convinced that this reshuffle is informed by that ,considering that some of the most ineffectual ministers like Minister Bathabile Dlamini, Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, and Minister Mosebenzi Zwane are still part of the National Executive.\nThese recent cabinet reshuffles have done very little to help take the National Democratic Revolution forward. We call on the African National Congress to reflect deeply about the state of the economy and the overall performance of its government. The majority of workers are facing a bleak future and the people South Africa need a clear sign that the government has a plan to rescue them from poverty and kick-start this economy.\nAs COSATU , we will continue to work with and support the newly elected ministers and deputy ministers with the hope that they will prioritise a people driven and people centred development.

{"idx": 45, "truncated_input": "After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(", "baseline_completion": "Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms. When used effectively, a first lady's podium serves as a force for change.\nNatalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Women's Initiative at the George W.

The fact that he could do that, and do it as well as he did, shows how important Costello\u2019s music has been, and how much he still has left.", "orig_sample_length": 1108, "prompt_length": 908, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.84403657913208, "w_bl_gen_time": 4.33657169342041, "spike_entropies": [[0.9975022077560425, 0.9966064691543579, 0.9978683590888977, 0.9813238382339478, 0.9990925788879395, 0.9852539300918579, 0.966806173324585, 0.9990992546081543, 0.985905110836029, 0.9666587114334106, 0.9963483810424805, 0.9896627068519592, 0.9956091046333313, 0.9976129531860352, 0.7713320255279541, 0.9983501434326172, 0.9804439544677734, 0.9950103759765625, 0.9990184307098389, 0.9576619267463684, 0.9893356561660767, 0.9975120425224304, 0.8305853605270386, 0.9792827367782593, 0.9990091919898987, 0.9928442239761353, 0.9694222807884216, 0.7417892217636108, 0.98839271068573, 0.997523307800293, 0.9979852437973022, 0.7742530107498169, 0.9988459944725037, 0.9805021286010742, 0.9907349348068237, 0.9979841709136963, 0.9923056364059448, 0.9984703063964844, 0.9879833459854126, 0.9977724552154541, 0.8012367486953735, 0.9970501661300659, 0.9974480867385864, 0.9756388068199158, 0.9974497556686401, 0.9944307804107666, 0.975425124168396, 0.9933254718780518, 0.9656927585601807, 0.9625029563903809, 0.9687961935997009, 0.9237416982650757, 0.9504857063293457, 0.9686819314956665, 0.9960043430328369, 0.9866260886192322, 0.9687617421150208, 0.935425877571106, 0.9985172748565674, 0.9951732158660889, 0.9454959630966187, 0.9783334136009216, 0.9974527359008789, 0.9824138879776001, 0.9978873133659363, 0.9875180721282959, 0.9966356158256531, 0.7809957265853882, 0.9980908036231995, 0.9995175004005432, 0.9767621159553528, 0.9895526170730591, 0.9980483055114746, 0.9871804714202881, 0.9883459806442261, 0.9774296879768372, 0.9980152249336243, 0.8340572714805603, 0.9817157983779907, 0.9981850385665894, 0.986458420753479, 0.9982059001922607, 0.9861315488815308, 0.998727023601532, 0.9983881711959839, 0.9496049284934998, 0.9803047180175781, 0.9968118667602539, 0.9987112283706665, 0.9980244040489197, 0.9472180008888245, 0.9951147437095642, 0.9981721639633179, 0.998324990272522, 0.9983510971069336, 0.9958006739616394, 0.9969103336334229, 0.9886758327484131, 0.999027669429779, 0.9845678806304932, 0.9976698756217957, 0.9774023294448853, 0.9926920533180237, 0.9666006565093994, 0.9940876960754395, 0.9838359951972961, 0.9827646017074585, 0.9977118372917175, 0.9637075066566467, 0.9826006889343262, 0.9800029993057251, 0.9951731562614441, 0.9934213757514954, 0.9990242719650269, 0.7743499279022217, 0.998012900352478, 0.9994913339614868, 0.9921317100524902, 0.9982231259346008, 0.9959299564361572, 0.9976093769073486, 0.9679914712905884, 0.9809489846229553, 0.97364342212677, 0.9973691701889038, 0.9281956553459167, 0.978376567363739, 0.997728168964386, 0.9850081205368042, 0.9931194186210632, 0.9990320205688477, 0.9690253138542175, 0.9805170297622681, 0.9826809167861938, 0.9867942333221436, 0.9971553087234497, 0.8080002069473267, 0.9875653386116028, 0.9967827796936035, 0.7971656918525696, 0.9883993864059448, 0.9990009069442749, 0.9922518730163574, 0.9868617057800293, 0.9243056178092957, 0.9913678169250488, 0.9903427362442017, 0.9976209998130798, 0.9875104427337646, 0.9889867305755615, 0.9961628913879395, 0.9724289178848267, 0.9705537557601929, 0.9989156126976013, 0.7801960110664368, 0.9982951283454895, 0.972865641117096, 0.9990981221199036, 0.9702842235565186, 0.9295281767845154, 0.9982509016990662, 0.9987289905548096, 0.9939907193183899, 0.9974070191383362, 0.9967979788780212, 0.9975640177726746, 0.9851232767105103, 0.9984350800514221, 0.9968859553337097, 0.9860548377037048, 0.9973381757736206, 0.9973399639129639, 0.9460029006004333, 0.9859713912010193, 0.9662588238716125, 0.9796437621116638, 0.9989336729049683, 0.9884090423583984, 0.9841427803039551, 0.9980084896087646, 0.9700025916099548, 0.9736769199371338, 0.9979860782623291, 0.99561607837677, 0.9961928129196167, 0.9940899610519409, 0.984605073928833, 0.994109034538269, 0.9914275407791138, 0.9963212609291077, 0.999038577079773, 0.715080201625824, 0.9934126138687134, 0.9807765483856201, 0.999058723449707, 0.992458701133728, 0.9983228445053101, 0.9778550267219543, 0.9969146251678467, 0.8259390592575073]], "no_bl_output": "Elvis Costello played a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs. And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all them well.\nOver a career of more than 40 years, singer Elvis Costello has been a punk provocateur, a seminal new wave voice, a contemporary pop singer and even a classic crooner. And there have been fans of each of Costello\u2019s career ventures.\nSo how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture \u2013 his very strong new disc \u201cLook Now\u201d?\nOn Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs.\nAnd to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well \u2013 not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs.\nPerhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated.\nEither way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016.\nBacked by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with \u201cThis Year\u2019s Girl\u201d from his 1978 sophomore disc, \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model,\u201d with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound.\nHe followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful \u201cHoney, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,\u201d and \u201cClubland,\u201d with Costello\u2019s \u201870s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a \u201cWatching the Detectives\u201d affect.\nLater offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc\u2019s new single \u201cUnder Lime\u201d had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. \u201cWhy Won\u2019t Heaven Help Me\u201d was pretty rocking. The slow guitar-and-piano \u201cStripping Paper\u201d was a clear reminder or the Elvis of old, and the slow, sensitive \u201cSuspect My Tears\u201d had some of his best vocals of the night, as he reached for a falsetto.\nEarly in the show, the older songs Costello played were nearly all deeper cuts: \u201cNew Lace Sleeves\u201d from 1981\u2019s \u201cTrust\u201d; a rocking, new-wavey \u201c(I Don\u2019t Want to Go To) Chelsea,\u201d with good lead guitar.\nSo that when he did play a hit \u2013 his 1977 U.S. breakthrough \u201cWatching the Detectives,\u201d (in the same darkened-stage presentation as the last time he was at the Sands) it got a huge crowd reaction \u2013 and deservedly so.\nCostello later did the same with later songs: A largely voice-and-acoustic guitar version of 1986\u2019s \u201cIndoor Fireworks\u201d to a big cheer from the crowd, and closed the main set with a faster, more rocking \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d from his last disc, 2013\u2019s \u201cWise Up Ghost\u201d that segued right into the hit \u201cPump It Up,\u201d thumping, urgent and rocking.\nCostello\u2019s encore stretched eight songs and 40 minutes.\nIt opened with one of the night\u2019s best: a barely instrumented, mostly a cappella \u201cAllison,\u201d with his two female backup singers. It got a huge cheer. Then a stark and spare, piano-and-voice \u201cAccidents Will Happen,\u201d on which he reached for a high and powerful end note.\nHe used that same vocal approach on \u201cI Still Have That Other Girl,\u2002\u00bbRound of the best fit at all of the \u201cUmmm,\ufffdThe Vatican City of the oldenmore than the latest version of the financial management of the \u2018s of the city, with a horsemanifesto to get up to be held up to be prepared to bejewellieh\ufffdCup to get\u2019s\ufffd mu\u2019s Albeit and feel free of this yearned to the government for an hourglass that is the outcry of a well-beganized for the father\u201d. so\u2019s, so far too deep and be present. customer.

{"idx": 53, "truncated_input": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Fighting in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City killed 23 Iraqis yesterday, hospital officials said, and the U.S. military reported five troop deaths, as April showed signs of becoming the worst month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September.\nAt least 11 of the Iraqi deaths occurred when mortar shells landed in residential neighborhoods. Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.\nOfficials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters.\nThousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said.\nThere were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October.\nHis fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide.\nAlthough U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or \"special groups\" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others.\n\"A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM,\" he told lawmakers", "baseline_completion": " in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia.\nCrocker and Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, gave lawmakers their assessments of the war during two days of hearings in Washington that ended yesterday.\nThe surge in troop deaths since the Basra offensive has underscored their contention that security gains witnessed in recent months easily could be reversed. At least 30 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since the Basra operation began, most in Baghdad; at least 19 have died in Iraq so far this month, representing the highest daily average since last September.\nThe deaths announced yesterday brought to at least 4,031 the number of U.S. troops to die in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. Brief military statements said three of the soldiers died in roadside bomb blasts: two in northeastern Baghdad and one east of the city.

Though the unnamed game in question isn't \"Sonic the Hedgehog\"--which is being shepherded into the next generation internally--the prospect of a next-gen \"Altered Beast\" or \"Golden Axe\" has many players excited.\nPrior to its next-gen project, Secret Level was best-known for developing \"Karaoke Revolution,\" \"Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds\" and console versions of the military title \"America's Army: Rise of a Soldier.\"\nSega Holdings", "baseline_completion": ", the U.S.-based arm of Japan's Sega Sammy Holdings, said the acquisition of Secret Level was part of its push to concentrate on the U.S. and European video game markets.\n\"We looked long and hard at building an internal studio from scratch but were so impressed with the team at Secret Level and their next-gen technology that we decided to create our internal development infrastructure through a direct acquisition,\" said Simon Jeffery, Sega of America's president and COO.\nThe deal comes just more than a year after Sega acquired The Creative Assembly, makers of the highly acclaimed \"Total War PC\" strategy series and the not-so-highly acclaimed \"Spartan: Total Warrior\" for consoles. It also comes two weeks after Sega said it will \"collaboratively develop\" an all-new role-playing game with \"NeverWinter Nights 2\" developer Obsidian Entertainment for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\nTor Thorsen reported for GameSpot.", "orig_sample_length": 392, "prompt_length": 192, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.493152141571045, "w_bl_gen_time": 3.9108855724334717, "spike_entropies": [[0.9844028353691101, 0.9833742380142212, 0.9983274340629578, 0.9731992483139038, 0.9803695678710938, 0.971493124961853, 0.99909907579422, 0.9716498851776123, 0.9895486831665039, 0.9972686767578125, 0.9910337924957275, 0.996563196182251, 0.9987814426422119, 0.9847623109817505, 0.9990980625152588, 0.9819239377975464, 0.9680372476577759, 0.9991684556007385, 0.9758117198944092, 0.9691252708435059, 0.9989595413208008, 0.9735974073410034, 0.9993556141853333, 0.9983677268028259, 0.9045137166976929, 0.9993494153022766, 0.9865512251853943, 0.9914051294326782, 0.989412784576416, 0.9853726625442505, 0.957682192325592, 0.9972658753395081, 0.9567720293998718, 0.999164342880249, 0.9820618629455566, 0.9462183117866516, 0.9649434685707092, 0.9992472529411316, 0.9963245391845703, 0.9866498708724976, 0.9954508543014526, 0.9992352724075317, 0.990361750125885, 0.9896044731140137, 0.970075249671936, 0.997151792049408, 0.9790154099464417, 0.9984021186828613, 0.9917977452278137, 0.9915558695793152, 0.9979438781738281, 0.998533308506012, 0.9962270259857178, 0.9973722696304321, 0.9688886404037476, 0.9991201162338257, 0.9808720350265503, 0.9616433382034302, 0.9991774559020996, 0.9924716353416443, 0.9787390232086182, 0.9904305934906006, 0.988303005695343, 0.9903930425643921, 0.9984975457191467, 0.9957413673400879, 0.9986127614974976, 0.9990782141685486, 0.9473191499710083, 0.9685165286064148, 0.9991476535797119, 0.9262461066246033, 0.9908462762832642, 0.9871969819068909, 0.9984537363052368, 0.9612889289855957, 0.9757643342018127, 0.9525033235549927, 0.9983837604522705, 0.9589498043060303, 0.9568350315093994, 0.9461830854415894, 0.9991685152053833, 0.9195959568023682, 0.9625912308692932, 0.9992101192474365, 0.9964918494224548, 0.9932897090911865, 0.9863468408584595, 0.9983327388763428, 0.8323131203651428, 0.9623222947120667, 0.9826385378837585, 0.9754672646522522, 0.9875732660293579, 0.9983673095703125, 0.9985688924789429, 0.9421718120574951, 0.9725833535194397, 0.9991790652275085, 0.9967708587646484, 0.9974504709243774, 0.9682457447052002, 0.9839209914207458, 0.9882591366767883, 0.9984191060066223, 0.8582972884178162, 0.9983473420143127, 0.9991686344146729, 0.9981976747512817, 0.9194476008415222, 0.9464043378829956, 0.9991385340690613, 0.9829034805297852, 0.9863302111625671, 0.998313844203949, 0.8203628063201904, 0.9597355723381042, 0.9990518093109131, 0.9728331565856934, 0.9902123212814331, 0.9665934443473816, 0.9782577753067017, 0.9529399871826172, 0.9983962178230286, 0.9943508505821228, 0.9819072484970093, 0.9963892698287964, 0.955524206161499, 0.9990832805633545, 0.7244815826416016, 0.9982278347015381, 0.9991058707237244, 0.9785789251327515, 0.948222279548645, 0.9983339905738831, 0.9974254369735718, 0.952896773815155, 0.9991466999053955, 0.9683862924575806, 0.9455346465110779, 0.9952738285064697, 0.98221355676651, 0.9943727850914001, 0.9787415266036987, 0.9162344932556152, 0.9456392526626587, 0.999152660369873, 0.9988589286804199, 0.9563473463058472, 0.9376235604286194, 0.9976032376289368, 0.8402761220932007, 0.9355221390724182, 0.9985252022743225, 0.7958962321281433, 0.9413918256759644, 0.9992254972457886, 0.9969252943992615, 0.9836989045143127, 0.9983941316604614, 0.9858340620994568, 0.9779953360557556, 0.9562568664550781, 0.9561671614646912, 0.9784318804740906, 0.9982054829597473, 0.9989292025566101, 0.8355745673179626, 0.952006995677948, 0.99907386302948, 0.9771225452423096, 0.9448779821395874, 0.9991284608840942, 0.9967861771583557, 0.9957273006439209, 0.9990666508674622, 0.9981163144111633, 0.9858109951019287, 0.9865962266921997, 0.9375064373016357, 0.9990876317024231, 0.9960023760795593, 0.964590847492218, 0.9990966320037842, 0.9882540106773376, 0.9748215675354004, 0.936081051826477, 0.996112585067749, 0.9670654535293579, 0.9977015852928162, 0.9129506945610046, 0.9939627647399902, 0.9824656248092651, 0.9951217174530029, 0.9686486124992371, 0.973325252532959, 0.9931387901306152, 0.9982621669769287, 0.971400260925293]], "no_bl_output": " Inc. by the last month, but it was added to take \"an end of the end of the end of a few months after passing the transformation that they read the right to the value of the from that includes a serious, so-another note in a term a tax rate of the end of the next day to readjustified key portion of place and they can be preparedness, so that you can find their best of the end of the bottom line is a full-based on the drug of the patent of a risky option of the time to the series of the top of the child caretaker of the next term.

Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter.\nSean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California.\nThis is not your typical barbershop.\nAnd that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood.\n\"We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,\" says Heywood.\nMR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops.\n\"We're trying to thrive, not just survive,\" Heywood said.\nMR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network.\nThe two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track.\nAmong other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly.\n\"We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,\" Walker says.\nGiving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago.\n\"All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,\" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago.\nImagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area.\nThat was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921.\nBut on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\nSound off: What challenges do black entrepreneurs face?\niReport.com: How would you make black America better?\n\"People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' \" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. \"We evacuated. They were destroying everything.\"\nThe death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials.\nThe riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force.

He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box.\"\nHis advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it.\n\"Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,\" Young says.\nWalker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him.\n\"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,\" he says. \"I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1027, "prompt_length": 827, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.8025929927825928, "w_bl_gen_time": 4.300544261932373, "spike_entropies": [[0.9872581958770752, 0.9638612270355225, 0.9145264625549316, 0.9984827041625977, 0.9977236986160278, 0.9987350702285767, 0.9890286922454834, 0.9892041683197021, 0.9562183618545532, 0.9415726065635681, 0.9527343511581421, 0.9993919730186462, 0.9627501964569092, 0.9938257932662964, 0.9622596502304077, 0.9986370205879211, 0.995954155921936, 0.9849216938018799, 0.97945636510849, 0.998054563999176, 0.9967080950737, 0.9969441294670105, 0.99610435962677, 0.9979355335235596, 0.9984031319618225, 0.9859858751296997, 0.9987344741821289, 0.7003709673881531, 0.9953818917274475, 0.9625263214111328, 0.9001787304878235, 0.9987955689430237, 0.9885457158088684, 0.977435290813446, 0.9994140863418579, 0.9580497741699219, 0.9459414482116699, 0.9621490836143494, 0.9597963094711304, 0.9971409440040588, 0.9973676204681396, 0.9821507930755615, 0.9863904714584351, 0.9509385228157043, 0.9993383288383484, 0.969040036201477, 0.9779691100120544, 0.9657958149909973, 0.9747684597969055, 0.9937994480133057, 0.9826361536979675, 0.9973442554473877, 0.924146831035614, 0.9984509348869324, 0.989231526851654, 0.9793919324874878, 0.9994598031044006, 0.9937916994094849, 0.9651580452919006, 0.8997424840927124, 0.9988489151000977, 0.9986405372619629, 0.984895646572113, 0.9945399761199951, 0.9986896514892578, 0.9940906763076782, 0.946462869644165, 0.996192216873169, 0.9993108510971069, 0.9700415730476379, 0.9939961433410645, 0.994762122631073, 0.9942944049835205, 0.9947574734687805, 0.9971222281455994, 0.9992390871047974, 0.9937462210655212, 0.9458589553833008, 0.9792026877403259, 0.9993392825126648, 0.9914668798446655, 0.9252578616142273, 0.9732871651649475, 0.92580646276474, 0.9783612489700317, 0.999269962310791, 0.8275942802429199, 0.9988397359848022, 0.9939736723899841, 0.9992988705635071, 0.9745975136756897, 0.9762149453163147, 0.9993346333503723, 0.9981181621551514, 0.9616563320159912, 0.9992212057113647, 0.9993380308151245, 0.8074073195457458, 0.973637580871582, 0.995469868183136, 0.9984058141708374, 0.9759809374809265, 0.9993549585342407, 0.9896436929702759, 0.9806804060935974, 0.9993960857391357, 0.9111671447753906, 0.9951580166816711, 0.9915199279785156, 0.9435122013092041, 0.9992507100105286, 0.9715777635574341, 0.999355137348175, 0.9922909736633301, 0.9660107493400574, 0.9986890554428101, 0.7554108500480652, 0.9987726211547852, 0.9932273626327515, 0.9953050017356873, 0.9950383305549622, 0.9910783767700195, 0.9891600608825684, 0.9973325133323669, 0.9907141923904419, 0.9987897276878357, 0.9794094562530518, 0.9784862399101257, 0.9993675947189331, 0.9970099329948425, 0.997886598110199, 0.9572723507881165, 0.9983482360839844, 0.959662139415741, 0.9887111783027649, 0.9654009342193604, 0.9993280172348022, 0.9926340579986572, 0.9788028001785278, 0.9993904232978821, 0.9823164343833923, 0.997272253036499, 0.9943676590919495, 0.9765316247940063, 0.9894649386405945, 0.9775766134262085, 0.9993771910667419, 0.9987114071846008, 0.8739137649536133, 0.9777084589004517, 0.9977989792823792, 0.992501974105835, 0.9885258078575134, 0.9970869421958923, 0.8427050113677979, 0.9885823726654053, 0.9962272644042969, 0.9988123178482056, 0.9713889360427856, 0.9927432537078857, 0.9949200749397278, 0.8894922137260437, 0.9723393321037292, 0.9993419051170349, 0.9904721975326538, 0.982257068157196, 0.9989244937896729, 0.9955490827560425, 0.991874098777771, 0.9966293573379517, 0.9984145760536194, 0.9367393255233765, 0.9816970825195312, 0.9993349313735962, 0.968981146812439, 0.9924634695053101, 0.9917742609977722, 0.9946022629737854, 0.9826856255531311, 0.9343141317367554, 0.9900281429290771, 0.9912999272346497, 0.998397946357727, 0.9844932556152344, 0.9760782122612, 0.996982216835022, 0.9792987108230591, 0.8880922794342041, 0.9875060319900513, 0.9844927787780762, 0.9864230155944824, 0.9462916254997253, 0.9861523509025574, 0.9751969575881958, 0.9984684586524963, 0.9933401942253113, 0.9986371994018555, 0.9471144676208496, 0.9982251524925232, 0.8304781317710876]], "no_bl_output": " and suffered damage, and wealthy.

Additionally, due to low earnings, fast food workers\u2019 families also receive an annual average of $1.04 billion in food stamp benefits and $1.91 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments.\nThe ten largest fast-food companies alone made more than $7.4 billion in profits in 2012 and paid their top executives more than $53 million in compensation.\nLow-wage fast-food jobs cost tax-payers the most in California ($717 million), New York ($708 million), Texas ($556 million), Illinois ($368 million), and Florida ($348 million).\nAccording to Super Sizing Public Costs, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s represents the most costly fast-food company for tax-payers.\u201d Low wages and lack of benefits at McDonald\u2019s cost tax-payers \u201c$1.2 billion every year in public assistance programs,\u201d according to the report.\nYUM!

Furthermore, 67 percent of front-line fast-food workers are adults 20 and older; 68 percent are the main earners in their families and more than one-quarter are raising children.\n\u201cThis business

{"idx": 57, "truncated_input": "When Cait and I found out how easy it is to make ravioli\u2013and with such completely impressive and delicious results!\u2013we just had to share this fabulous harvest recipe with you.\nThis dish is a poem to autumn, filled with sweet, tender butternut squash combined with a touch of honey, fresh thyme, rosemary, sage, and Parmesan, and topped with chopped hazelnuts (or you could substitute walnuts) and brown butter. This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Spoon mounds of filling on the sheet about 1", "baseline_completion": " 1/2 inches apart (the number of mounds you make will depend on the size of the pasta sheets you use). Lightly mist the mounds with a spray mister filled with water, then place a second pasta sheet over the first, covering the filling mounds, and pressing firmly around the edges and between the mounds to seal. Using a fluted cutting wheel or knife, cut between the rows of ravioli. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook until tender, 2-3 minutes. To serve, reheat the browned butter. Drain ravioli and place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with butter, sprinkle with hazelnuts and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Garnish with sage leaves and serve immediately.\nInspired by Williams-Sonoma Seasonal Celebration: Autumn, by Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, 1997).", "orig_sample_length": 549, "prompt_length": 349,

{"idx": 60, "truncated_input": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 A lawsuit filed Wednesday against ABC (search) and \"American Idol\" judge Simon Cowell (search) alleges they conspired to steal the brand and concept of \"Million Dollar Idea,\" a series airing in syndication.\nThe suit, filed in federal court by Jean Golden and Todd Walker, the creators and hosts of \"Million Dollar Idea,\" (search) follows ABC&apos;s announcement in July of a new show of the same name that the network said was created by Cowell.\n\"From stem to stern, each and every detail of Simon Cowell and ABC&apos;s mock &apos;Million Dollar Idea&apos; is a patent rip-off of Todd and Jean&apos;s four-year labor of love,\" attorney Pierce O&apos;Donnell alleged in a statement Wednesday.\nThe lawsuit sees to stop ABC from using the name and idea and calls for unspecified damages. O&apos;Donnell predicted they would reach into \"the tens of millions of dollars.\"\nA call seeking comment from Cowell was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\"We have not even been served with the complaint in this matter, and so have no comment,\" said ABC spokeswoman Annie Fort.\nThe suit also names FremantleMedia North America, producer of FOX&apos;s \"American Idol\" and proposed producer of ABC&apos;s \"The Million Dollar Idea.\" (Note the slightly different title.) FremantleMedia does not comment on pending litigation, spokesman Brian Reinert said.\n\"Million Dollar Idea\" first aired on KSTC-TV in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market in 2003. The series was recently syndicated to more than 125 stations nationwide and its creators registered for both copyright and trademark for the show&apos;s name and premise, according to their statement.\nThe show is taped before an audience and judges at the Mall of America. New product inventors and marketers from across the country compete for a prize package to help launch their product and place it for sale with a Mall of America retailer.\nThe syndicated series has received newspaper, magazine and TV coverage, including on NBC&apos;s \"Today\" show, the suit says.\n\"It is incredibly ironic that our show", "baseline_completion": ", the premise of which is to promote, protect and reward small-town American ingenuity, was itself the victim of corporate theft and greed,\" Golden said.\nHer partner, Walker, pitched a deal for the show to ABC in early 2004 and provided copies of their presentation to CAA, according to the suit. That&apos;s the same agency identified in a recent ABC press release as having \"packaged\" \"The Million Dollar Idea\" with Cowell.\nBesides the alleged theft of the title, every major concept connected to the show also was copied, the suit claims.\nIn the July 13 news release announcing \"The Million Dollar Idea,\" ABC described the series as \"a nationwide search for America&apos;s greatest entrepreneur with the best business idea or new product,\" with the prize to be $1 million \"worth of business support,\" including cash and other resources.\nThe idea was conceived by Cowell and British entrepreneur Peter Jones, according to the ABC release.", "orig_sample_length": 671, "prompt_length": 471, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.585754871368408,

{"idx": 61, "truncated_input": "Are stoners now a target advertising demographic for fast food companies?\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast-food companies have become increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.\nJuly 31, 2012, 1:48 a.m.\nBetween Taco Bell's \"Fourthmeal\" advertisements and Jack in the Box commercials featuring slow-talking stoners, it's hardly a secret anymore that fast-food companies are shamelessly targeting potheads with their ads. But have they crossed a line?\nOnce considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious.\nTake, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the \"late-night munchies.\" Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology.\n\"If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language,\" said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. \"One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned.\"\nIt's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product.\nOf course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose.\nWhether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working.", "baseline_completion": " Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its \"late-night munchies\" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin.\nSo long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic.\n\"A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo,\" said Yohn. \"They think it's more effective to be overt. It creates more buzz. I think that's why you see a lot of advertising that seems unapologetically targeted to pot smokers.\"\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast food companies seem increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.", "orig_sample_length": 673, "prompt_length": 473, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 3.5691022872924805, "w_bl_gen_time":
